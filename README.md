This repository is home to the code as well as the deployment of my personal portfolio website. The website is created using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) Framework, (with TypeScript, vuex, router) and the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) Material Design Component Framework and is automatically built and deployed to Github Pages using Travis-CI. 

You can find the live version to my site [here](https://achermack.github.io)

# A note about branches
* develop (default)
  * Used as the default branch containing the Vue/Vuetify source code.
* master
  * Github Pages requires user pages to be deployed from master, thus master is home to the bare HTML that Vue generates when the production version is built.
